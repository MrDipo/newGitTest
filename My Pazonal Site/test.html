        <p>There is a simple reason why 'Web Developer' is such a hot job right now. Put simply, what Web Developers do is create how we experience the web. If you proceed from the notion that every person who engages with the web would prefer a great expreience, then you can say that everyone who engages with the web would prefer that a Web Develope does a great job. Companies of course know this, so they hire Web Developers to esure theri sites provide great experineces. So, lots of websites and lots of users means lots of demand. LOTS of demand.ðŸ”¥</p>
